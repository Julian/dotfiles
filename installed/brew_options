As of now, homebrew's options system is a bit useless. It won't remember what
options a formula was installed with. Until I become less lazy and either help
them write something (they've said it's in the works) and / or write something
myself to manage it, here's a rough list of what I've got that needs to have
some options set when installed:

* mutt
    * --sidebar-patch
    * --trash-patch

* macvim
    * --override-system-vim
    * --enable-clipboard

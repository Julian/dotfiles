# Beautiful X-Chat inspired irssi theme by rolle @ QuakeNet
# http://roni.laukkarinen.info
#
#-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=~
#
# NOTE FOR FINNISH USERS:
#
# Jos olet suomalainen ja pidät teemasta, joini ihmeessä
# kanavalle #pulina quakenetissä. Lisää tietoa kanavasta:
# http://www.pulina.fi
#
# Ja jos tykkäsit, mikset sanoisi kiitokset privassa,
# jotta tiedän että tätä käyttää joku :-)
#
#-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=~
#
# Inspired by X-Chat.
# (not the xchat-irssi-theme: THE X-Chat-theme)
#
#-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=~
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# Make sure this is the latest version and use the tutorial
# provided in https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/weed
#
# Without actions in the tutorial the theme WILL NOT WORK 
# PROPERLY! 
#
# Always backup your ~/.irssi -folder before trying!

Solarized Color Theme for irssi
===============================

Initially created by [huyz](https://github.com/huyz), this is a
repository of themes for the [irssi] IRC chat client that support Ethan
Schoonoverâ€™s [Solarized] color scheme.

implementations for terminal emulators and other applications, such as Vim,
Emacs, and Mutt.

Universal theme
---------------

The first irssi theme, called "universal", was designed to work best with both
Solarized Dark and Light palettes, but also to work under default terminal
colors. In other words, this theme was designed with a "fallback" scenario: if
you happen to find yourself on a terminal where the Solarized palette has not
been set up, you won't have elements become invisible or incrediby hard to
read.

Thus, this theme was designed with these 4 palettes in mind:

-   Solarized Dark: the theme works best when the terminal emulator is
    set to this scheme
-   Solarized Light: the theme works, when the terminal emulator is set
    to this scheme, almost as well as with Solarized Dark (you probably won't
    notice the difference, but if you do, it could be optimized slightly by
    switching the theme's use of some of the Solarized base colors)
-   Default terminal ANSI Colors with a dark background
-   Default terminal ANSI Colors with a light background

This theme was designed to be clean and functional, starting from the default
theme distributed with irssi.  Colors are strictly used for functionality and
the number of colors visible is minimized when possible. Colors were selected
based on the characteristics of the text characters to be displayed:

-   Visibility generally follows importance, with an attempt to let unimportant
    text fade into the background (which is not always possible when
    simultaneously supporting dark and light backgrounds)
-   Loud colors are chosen to call attention to noteworthy messages

Downloads
---------

If you have come across these themes via the [irssi-only repository] on github,
you may want to check the main [Solarized repository] to see if there is an
official theme.

In the future, the [irssi-only repository] may be kept in sync with the main
[Solarized repository], but the [irssi-only repository] may be left separate
for installation convenience and to include the latest improvements.

At this time, issues, bug reports, changelogs are to be reported at the
[irssi-only repository].

Installation
------------

1.  Configure your terminal emulator (See the section "Understanding Solarized Colors in
    Terminals" for a detailed explanation behind these settings)

    1.  Make sure that you have changed your terminal emulator's color settings to
        the Solarized palette.

    2.  Make sure that bold text is displayed using bright colors. For example,
        -   For iTerm2 on OS X, this means that Text Preferences must have the `Draw
            bold text in bright colors` checkbox *selected*.
        -   For Apple's Terminal.app on OS X, this means that Text Settings must
            have the `Use bright colors for bold text` checkbox *selected*.

    3.  It's recommended to turn off the display of bold typeface for bold
        text.  For example,
        -   For iTerm2 on OS X, this means that Text Preferences should have the
            `Draw bold text in bold font` checkbox *unselected*.
        -   For Apple's Terminal.app on OS X, this means that Text Settings
            should have the `Use bold fonts` checkbox *unselected*.
        -   For XTerm, this may mean setting the `font` and `boldFont` to be the
            same in your .Xresources or .Xdefaults, e.g.:

                xterm*font: fixed
                xterm*boldFont: fixed

    Example: for iTerm2, these are the correct settings:

    ![iTerm bold settings](https://github.com/huyz/irssi-colors-solarized/raw/master/img/screen-iTerm2-bold-options.png)

2.  Obtain `solarized-universal.theme`

    a) Option A: Download `solarized-universal.theme` from [irssi-only repository]
       and place it in your `~/.irssi` directory

    b) Option B: To always have the latest version, clone the git repository:

        $ git clone git://github.com/huyz/irssi-colors-solarized.git
        $ ln -s $PWD/irssi-colors-solarized/solarized-universal.theme ~/.irssi/.

3.  Change your `~/.irssi/config` to include the following settings, while making
    sure to replace `YOUR_NICKNAME` with your IRC nickname:

        settings = {
            ...
            "fe-common/core" = {
                ...
                # Solarized
                theme = "solarized-universal";
                hilight_color = "= %R";
            };
            ...
        };
        hilights = (
                { text = "YOUR_NICKNAME"; color = "%M"; nick = "yes"; word = "yes"; }
        );
        statusbar = {
            ...
            items = {
                ...
                # Solarized
                lag = "{sb Lag: %m$0-%n}";
                act = "{sb Act: $0-}";
                more = "%k%3-- more --%n";
            };
            ...
        };

4.  Optionally, if you have the `adv_windowlist.pl` or `trackbar.pl` scripts
    installed, modify your `~/.irssi/config` so that:

        settings = {
            ...
            "perl/core/scripts" = {
                ...
                ### For Solarized adv_windowlist.pl script
                awl_display_key_active = "%k%2[$Q=$N:$C]%n";
                awl_display_nokey_active = "%k%2[$N:$C]%n";
                awl_display_key = "[$Q:$H$C$S]";
                awl_display_nokey = "[$N:$H$C$S]";
        
                ### For Solarized trackbar.pl script
                trackbar_style = "%B";
            };
            ...
        };

Understanding Solarized Colors in Terminals
-------------------------------------------

### Solarized Colors vs. ANSI Colors ###

8-color terminal programs such as irssi use color codes that correspond to the
expected 8 normal ANSI colors.  irssi additionally supports bold, which
terminal emulators will usually display by using the *bright* versions of the 8
ANSI colors and/or by using a bold typeface with a heavier weight. (Note that
different terminal emulators may have slightly different ideas of what color
values to use when displaying the 16 [ANSI color escape
codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors).)

In order to be displayed by 8-color terminal programs, which cannot specify RGB
values, Solarized must replace the default ANSI colors.  Since the Solarized
palette uses 16 colors, not only must this color scheme replace the 8 normal
colors but must also take over the 8 *bright* colors, for a total of 16 colors.
This means that a Solarized terminal application loses the ability to bold text
but gains 8 more Solarized colors.

About half of the Solarized palette is reminiscent of the original ANSI
colors, e.g. Solarized red is close to ANSI red (or more precisely, the
general consensus of what ANSI red should look like).  But the rest of the
Solarized colors do not correspond to any ANSI colors, e.g. there is no ANSI
color that corresponds to Solarized orange or purple.

This means that, for example, if the irssi theme wants to display "green", a
Solarized terminal will display something close to green, but if the theme
wants to display "bold yellow" or "bright yellow", a Solarized terminal will
not be able to display it.  However, a Solarized theme will be able to display
the new colors orange and purple and also several shades of gray.  This is
again thanks to the replacement of the ANSI *bright* colors; e.g. ANSI "bold
red", which is usually displayed as "bright red", will now show as Solarized
orange, while ANSI "bold blue", which is usually displayed as "bright blue",
will now be a shade of gray.

### Terminal Emulator ###

Because irssi is an ANSI 8-color terminal program, it is entirely dependent on
the terminal emulator for the display of its colors.  You cannot directly tell
an irssi theme to display Solarized orange, e.g. by specifying an RGB value.
Instead, the theme's colors must be chosen using the ANSI color codes with the
expectation that the terminal emulator will display them as appropriate
Solarized colors.  For example, the irssi color format `%R` which normally
would be "bold red" is expected to be displayed by the terminal emulator as
Solarized orange.

So in order for irssi to display the Solarized palette, you have to set your
Terminal emulator's color settings to the Solarized palette. The [Solarized
repository] includes theme settings for some popular terminal emulators as
well as Xresources; or you can download them from the official [Solarized]
homepage. If you use the irssi themes *without* having changed your
emulator's palette, you will get a strange selection of colors that may be
hard to read.

Yes, this means that, to use the Solarized theme for irssi, you need to change
color settings for not one but two different programs: your terminal emulator
and irssi.  The two sets of settings will work in concert to display Solarized
colors appropriately.

### Bold Settings ###

Historically, there has been a one-to-one correspondence between the bolded
versions of the 8 default ANSI colors and the bright versions of the 8 default
colors.  Back in the day, when a color program demanded the display of bold
text, it was probably just easier for terminal emulators to display a brighter
version of whatever color the text was (and expect the user to interpret that
as bold) than to display a typeface with a bold weight

Nowadays, it is easy for terminal emulators to display bold typefaces, so it
doesn't make sense for bolded text to change color, but the confusing
association remains. In fact, new terminal emulators allow users to break the
correspondence between bold and bright and can simply change the font.

However, ANSI 8-color terminal applications such as irssi only have a
conception of bold and don't know about the possibility of using up to 16
colors.  So to use all 16 Solarized colors, we change the semantics of "bold"
in the theme to mean that we want to access the 8 new Solarized colors,
including the grays. Recall the example above, where we described that the
irssi color format `%R`, which would have normally displayed bold red, is
expected to show up as Solarized orange.

This is why it is important to *not* break the association between bold and
bright colors. Many terminal emulators offer an option to disable the use of
bright colors for bold, and you must not do so.  Often, new users of Solarized
will be confused when they change their terminal emulator's color palette to
Solarized but haven't yet installed Solarized-specific color themes for all
their terminal applications (e.g. mutt, ls's dircolors, irssi, and their
colorized shell prompts).  They will see texts that are hard to read or
disappear entirely.  The solution isn't to disable bright colors; the solution
is to install Solarized color themes for all terminal applications and then you
will have all 16 colors.

Also, because the semantics of "bold" are lost in favor of more colors, it
also makes sense to disable the display of bold text as a bold typeface.  It
won't hurt to see bold typefaces wherever the new 8 Solarized colors are
displayed but it doesn't make much sense anymore.
